# Hanz Hendrick Lacsi â€” One-Page Portfolio

A modern, responsive one-page portfolio built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes sections for Home, About, Projects, Skills, Certifications, and Contact, with smooth scrolling and a fixed navigation bar.

## Features
- Sticky, translucent navbar with smooth scrolling
- Responsive layout (cards and grids)
- Accessible form with client-side validation (mailto fallback)
- Subtle hover effects and active nav highlighting
- Google Fonts (Poppins) and professional blue/navy palette

## Getting Started
Just open `index.html` in your browser.

Optionally, serve over a local web server.

### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
# If you have Python installed
python -m http.server 5500
# Then open http://localhost:5500/
```

## Customize
- Edit text and sections in `index.html`.
- Tweak colors and layout in `styles.css`.
- Adjust behavior in `script.js`.

## Notes
- The contact form uses a `mailto:` link to open your email client. For real submissions, connect it to a backend or a service like Formspree.
